This is an introductory work on simple genetic algorithm(GA).
1. Bag Packing Problem-> is to determine the optimal(best or more favorable) contents of the bag. The items have a weight(can think of it as physical weight) and survival value(how important an item is for saurvival).

2. Travelling Salesperson -> Considering a set of cities with known stymmetric intra_distances, this problem involves finding an optimal route for visiting all cities and return to the starting point(city) such that the distance travelled is minimized.
